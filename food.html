					<h5>Directions:</h5>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">In a medium stainless sauté pan set over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Using a whisk, whisk the butter continuously until the liquid becomes foamy with audible cracking and popping noises. At this point lower the heat to about medium-low, once the crackling becomes quieter, continue to swirl the pan or stir until the butter develops a nutty aroma and brown bits start to form at the bottom. Once the bits are amber in color, remove from heat and pour into a large heat-safe mixing bowl. Be sure to keep the brown bits at the bottom of the pan as they hold so much flavor!</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar to the hot butter, stirring to combine. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">In a medium bowl, combine the flours, baking soda, salt, and baking powder.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">To the cooled butter mixture, whisk in the eggs, yolk, and vanilla until combined. Gradually stir in the flour mixture with a rubber spatula. Stir in the chocolate chunks and toffee bits if you've elected to add those. Leave dough in mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. You can also let it sit in the freezer for about 4-6 hours though letting it sit in the fridge for minimum 24 hours is recommended.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">Let dough sit at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop, about 1 hour.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Line baking sheets with silicone baking sheet.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large cookie scoop and drop onto prepared baking sheets. Dough may be slightly challenging to scoop.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">At this point, you can portion the dough, place it on a baking sheet, and freeze just until solid. Remove frozen balls of dough to an airtight container and store for up to 6 weeks.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">Bake for 12 minutes, then afterwards flip the pan(s) 180 degrees and bake for another 4-6 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven and sprinkle sea salt on top of the cookies, if desired, though highly recommended. Let cookies cool for 2 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.</p>
					
					<p class="specialmargin">Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</p>
